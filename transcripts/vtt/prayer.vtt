00:00:43.240 --> 00:01:11.130
Savior what mortal  can touch the beauty of this book of Hebrews without ruining it Lord.

2
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:37.130
We are incapable of touching a book so awesome, so precious, with a message directly from your heart Lord.


3
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:57.935
I beg you Lord, that during this days that you maybe are our teacher, that you may break us the Bread of Life. 

4
00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:19.835
Open our eyes and our spirits  that we may see the glory of your face that shines through This message of Hebrews.

5
00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:29.735
Open our hearts to the revelation in your beauty that is here;

6
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:36.655
That we may never again walk in the same manner Lord.

7
00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:53.355
Oh plant in the deepest of our heart the beauties, the truths and the glory that is here Lord.

8
00:02:53.355 --> 00:03:08.755
That is they may never be forgotten, Oh Lord roots these truths in our hearts.

9
00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:28.788
Oh Savior, that allways in the valley of the shadow of death we may have the grace to return to the beauty revealed here Lord. 

10
00:03:28.788 --> 00:03:46.488
Jesus Christ we are waiting in you, trusting in you, Oh Master of Galilee,  teach us please.

11
00:03:46.488 --> 00:04:02.988
Lord in The name of your precious Son, we ask you, we beg you, thanking you.

12
00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:09.925
For the crumbs from your table, thank you Lord.
