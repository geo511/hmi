Now something else that for a Jew this book proves clearly is

1
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.430
That Christ is our High Priest,

2
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.480
A radical change for a Jew,

3
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.030
The High Priest was the man most respected human being on the planet,

4
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:40.830
Maybe the High Priest Was more respected than the Pope who’s respected today,

5
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:52.780
Because he every year made an atonement and the atonement of their souls depended on him,

6
00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.130
Before God if he had a position of  honor, much honor as Hebrews 4 says.

7
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:08.090
Now in previous courses of Hebrews we have seen scriptures here in Hebrews

8
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:17.130
That talk about the High Priesthood of Christ, but I believe that we owe honor to  who deserves honor,

9
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.870
And Brother Juan Carlos, a good student of the Bible,

10
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.030
One time ago shown me that The main revelation of the High Priest in Hebrews

11
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.430
Is ministry on the Day of Atonement( Yom Kippur),

12
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:47.230
There is no doubt that it is true, it is true and we will study this, we’ll see this during the course

13
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:57.330
It is a very important key, but that It was a good spark in my heart, thanks to the brother

14
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.510
And I began to see that there is a reason, very important reason 

15
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:13.510
For which  Christ is presented here as the High Priest on the day of atonement

16
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.530
And and we will see it, so that’s the brief introduction.
