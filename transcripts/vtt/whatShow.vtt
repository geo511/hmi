The author of Hebrews

1
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:15.030
Proves that the New Testament is a fulfillment of the shadows that the Old Testament give us,

2
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.280
Showing that the Old Testament, the rituals, and all the law of Moses is a shadow

3
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.620
Of the life that we have in Christ Jesus;

4
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:36.130
But with a difference: the key word in Hebrews is the word <b>BETTER</b>

5
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.780
Because the fulfillment is better than the shadow, amen?

6
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.530
Who wants to live  the shadow? Who wants to dedicate himself to the shadow?

7
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.090
Here on this platform my body is casting a shadow here on the wall

8
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:07.130
And you can study the shadow and discover many things, one thing that I notice here is that that person has glasses,

9
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:16.370
You can study, search The shadow and learn many things and there are no lies in the shadow,

10
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.730
But why studying the shadow so much? No  I am not saying that you should not study the old testament, no, no, no

11
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.430
Why search deeply in the shadow when we can see the Life?

12
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.230
Who cast the shadow of the old testament? Paul says: Christ himself and the life  in him, amen?

13
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.330
Do not misunderstand me!, I am not minimizing the importance of the old testament at all,

14
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:53.010
It is more human beings, very carnal, earthly, it is impossible to understand the spiritual

15
00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:03.730
Without Understand the earthly, which the old testament gives us and reveal to us, impossible!
