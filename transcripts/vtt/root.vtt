00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840
Now I am in the process of writing a new book

1
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.830
Demonstrating or proving something very important, not something of mine, something from the Bible,

2
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.180
From history, something very important 

3
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:40.420
The root of Christianity, it is not at all, rabinic Judaism 

4
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:57.130
The root of Christianity in no moment is rabinic Judaism as a practiced today

5
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.340
And it is a great danger to think so,

6
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.530
To think that it is a root, has nothing to do and we will see it in the book, not in this course.
