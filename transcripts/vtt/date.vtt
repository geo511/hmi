The date (as I told you) for sure it was written before the year 95D.C.

1
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:17.440
But we know from the book itself that the book was written before  the year 70D.C. When the temple was destroyed,

2
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:27.430
Because the author of Hebrews metions  the tabernacle or temple and priesthood that was still functioning,

3
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:35.630
For example in <b>Hebrews 8: 4</b> <i> For if he were on earth,</i>

4
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.430
<i>He should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law</i> 

5
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.930
In <b>Hebrews 8:13</b> <i>In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.</i>

6
00:00:49.930 --> 00:01:00.330
<i>Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</i></p>

7
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:11.630
We have an altar from which they have no right to eat</i> those who serve the Tabernacle

8
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.630
Or are still serving in the temple in the Tabernacle, 

9
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:28.330
So it was written before 70 D.C. And the evidence gives us the idea that it was written  before the year 70D.C.

10
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:42.930
And I personally, I doubt that Paul is the author, but we have we are not sure about it.
